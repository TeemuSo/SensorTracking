"# SensorTracking" 

This application is inteded to be used in co-operation with Raspberry Pi 3. From sensors MPU-9250, and SenseHat() are supported. You need to do slight changes to "get_sensor_values.py", depending on which sensor you are using. Right now scripts are working for MPU-9250.

For car movements, I2C bus PCA9685 is used. This project also includes the necessary controllers for it.
